### Description

This model is used for segmentation of images (particularly medical images). It has a encoding/decoding structure, with some skip connections in between. The architecture is very strong in working with a small dataset and yields precise segmentations in a short time. The model is fully convolutional. In this script, the size of the input image is 256 x 256.
