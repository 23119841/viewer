### Description

EfficientNet-Lite4 has been developed for image classification. It achieves high accuracy and is designed to run on mobile CPU (in addition to GPU, and TPU) where computational resources are limited. The input is an RBG image with the size of 224 x 224 x 3. Output of the model is an array score with the length of 1000.
